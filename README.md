# Few-shot-Fantasy-Character-Generation
In this project a Large Larguage Model (LLM) is prmpted to generate novel fictional character that could come out of The Lord of The Ring or a Dungeons and Dragons adventure.

The LLM is promped with to solve three tasks in sequence: 
1) generate a **fantasy character** (recursive)
2) generate **features** for each character
3) generate a **short story** given a character as protagonist and the corresponding features.

Here are some outputs obtained from the three steps:
1) Barbarian, Monk, Rogue, Druid, Cleric, Fighter, Priest, Ranger, Paladin, Sorcerer. 
2) *Wizard*: I am wise and intelligent. I can read the minds of others. I can control the elements. I know secrets of the universe.
3) (*Assassin, I kill people who deserve to die. I am smart. I am paid to kill. I use poison to kill people.*): An assassin was hired by a king to kill a king. The assassin was smart and well paid for his work. He used poison to kill his victims. He did not care about the reasons why he was killing his victims.
